# T-Shirt-Hall

## Description
For this project we created a website where the user can view and buy super cool unique shirts.
These aren't your typical "Target" brand shirts, these are super cool aesthetic shirts!

## Usage
When the user enters the site they are presented with various "aesthetic" shirts. The user user is then able to select a size using a drop menu and then add that shirt to their cart. In order for the use to view their cart they must log in or create an account. The cart saves the users selections so that they can then checkout and purchase the shirt(purchase feature not added yet)
If the user has any questions about the shirts they can ``click`` onb the "frequently asked Q's" button at the top and they are given a sample exanple of a common customer question. 
## Installation
